            served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found<br>
             that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), <br>
             cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as<strong> turmeric,<br>
              paprika,</strong> tomato purée or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance
